        <h1>Which hospitals have tanks surrounded? </h1>
    <p ><dfn>’s Ministry of Health says</dfn> Israeli tanks on Friday surrounded four hospitals from all directions. These are the al-Rantisi Hospital, al-Nasr Hospital, and the eye and mental health hospitals.

        About 1,000 people are seeking shelter at al-Rantisi, the only hospital in Gaza that specialises in treating children with cancer. Israel has recently struck vehicles outside al-Rantisi, which is located in northern Gaza.
        
        
        A video surfaced on social media apparently shot by people inside the hospital that shows them unsure of whether to evacuate, given instances from this war of people fleeing from danger zones being bombed</p>
       <h2> Al-Rantisi Children Hospital</h2>

       <p class="al rantisi">Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi Hospital (Arabic: مستشفى الرنتيسي) is a children's hospital in the Nasser neighborhood of Gaza City.[1] It is named after Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, leader and co-founder of Hamas.

        The hospital's pediatric palliative care unit, the Dr. Musa And Suhaila Nasir Pediatric Cancer Department, was created in 2019 by U.S. charity Palestine Children's Relief Fund.[2][3]
        
        As of November 2023, Bakr Gaoud was the head of the hospital.</p>

 <div id="al shifa"><h2>What about al-Shifa Hospital?</h2>
<p>The compound of al-Shifa Hospital, the Gaza Strip’s largest medical facility, was hit by an Israeli missile overnight, and it wasn’t a one-off strike.

    Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said on Friday that Israel has bombed al-Shifa Hospital buildings five times since Thursday night.
    
    The hospital has been a repeated Israeli target over the past month. World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson Margaret Harris warned that the hospital is “coming under bombardment”.
    
    “You can hear a lot of gunshots, and then you know that the tanks are getting near to al-Shifa Hospital,” Dr Ahmed Mokhallalati, an al-Shifa surgeon, told Al Jazeera</p>

<div id="Al ahli hos"><h2> Al_Ahli Hospital Attack</h2>
    <p>On October 18, nearly 500 people were killed in an air attack on Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in the besieged Gaza Strip.</p>
   <figure> <p><img src="c:\Users\AA\Downloads\6000.avif" width="280px" height="170px" />
<figurecaption>Some Views of Al-Hira hospital in gaza</figurecaption></figure>
    
    WHO strongly condemns the attack on Al Ahli Arab Hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip. The hospital was operational, with patients, health and care givers, and internally displaced people sheltering there. Early reports indicate hundreds of fatalities and injuries.

The hospital was one of 20 in the north of the Gaza Strip facing evacuation orders from the Israeli military. The order for evacuation has been impossible to carry out given the current insecurity, critical condition of many patients, and lack of ambulances, staff, health system bed capacity, and alternative shelter for those displaced.

WHO calls for the immediate active protection of civilians and health care. Evacuation orders must be reversed. International humanitarian law must be abided by, which means health care must be actively protected and never targeted.</p></div>
<div id="so far">
    <h2>What has happened so far?</h2>
<p>Twenty one of Gaza’s 35 hospitals with inpatient facilities have stopped functioning either due to damage from shelling  and air strikes or from the lack of fuel, Gaza’s Health Ministry said.

    Israeli strikes have targeted Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis and Al-Quds Hospital along with two centres of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Jabalia and Gaza City, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported. Gaza’s Health Ministry was also targeted.
    
    
    
    The Gaza Health Ministry said the blast was caused by an Israeli air raid. Israel attributed the explosion to a misfired rocket launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad armed group.</p>
</div>
<div id="hos impacted"><h2>How are hospital functions impacted? </h2>
    <p>Several hospital departments have been targeted by Israel, compromising hospital functions and damaging buildings and equipment.According to al-Qudra, Israel shelled the maternity department and outpatient clinics at al-Shifa this week.

        Gaza is under a total blockade by Israel. Al-Shifa has been denied urgently needed supplies of medicines and fuel. Fuel shortages threaten the function of generators, which run vital equipment like ventilators and dialysis machines.
        
        An unprecedented influx of wounded patients coupled with medical supplies that are rapidly running out leaves surgeons with no choice but to operate on patients on floors and without anaesthetics or pain relief.
        
        “It is painful for the medical team. It is not simple. It is either the patient suffers pain or loses his life,” said Mohammad Abu Salmiya, director general of al-Shifa Hospital.
        
        Both al-Rantisi and al-Shifa are located in northern Gaza. UN humanitarian office spokesperson Jens Laerke said the aid entering Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt cannot enter northern Gaza. He urged Israel to reopen the Karem Abu Salem crossing, known in Hebrew as the Kerem Shalom crossing, which sits at the junction of Gaza’s border with Egypt and Israel, to allow more aid through.</p>

</div>
<div id="international says ">
    <h2>What does international law say about attacking hospitals?</h2>
<p>International humanitarian law based on the 1949 Geneva Conventions considers hospitals civilian objects that receive protection.

    However, the 1977 Additional Protocols to the conventions outline some exceptions to this. Article 13 states that medical units shall lose their special protection if “used to commit, outside their humanitarian function, acts harmful to the enemy”. In such cases, it says, warnings and “a reasonable time limit” should be given before an attack.</p></div>
